I worked with a product manager to document this **API** endpoint for updating a Workato embedded account's data retention period. The product manager provided the endpoint URL and a sample request body, and I tested the endpoint to retrieve the output.

    You can view the [webpage](https://docs.workato.com/oem/oem-api/data-retention.html){ target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" } on Workato's docs site. Be aware that the page may have been updated since I wrote it in January 2024.
