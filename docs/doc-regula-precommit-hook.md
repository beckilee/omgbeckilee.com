I wrote this **procedure** to explain how to use a pre-commit hook to check infrastructure-as-code for policy violations before the code is committed. An engineer provided the initial `.pre-commit-config.yaml` configuration. I modified the hook slightly, and then I tested it on HashiCorp Terraform and AWS CloudFormation configurations I had written.
