I developed a two-day course teaching beginners how to write Rego, Open Policy Agent's policy-as-code language. I also wrote an accompanying 180-page training manual, which I later adapted into a series of **tutorial** blog posts.

This blog series is composed of three parts:

- [Part 1](https://snyk.io/blog/introduction-to-rego/){ target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" }, shown above, teaches basic Rego concepts.
- [Part 2](https://snyk.io/blog/rego-for-beginners-part-2/){ target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" } teaches intermediate Rego syntax.
- [Part 3](https://snyk.io/blog/rego-103-values-and-rules/){ target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" } teaches types of values and rules.

All three articles were published after I left Snyk. A colleague kindly contributed minor updates to the second and third pieces.
