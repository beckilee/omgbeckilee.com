I wrote a **beginner's guide** to AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) endpoints. To write it, I interviewed Fugue's director of security and extensively reviewed AWS's documentation. I then validated the information by deploying and testing infrastructure in my AWS account. The images are from AWS's docs.

This blog post performed very highly when it was published. For a long time, it was the first Google result for "vpc endpoints" after AWS's own documentation.
