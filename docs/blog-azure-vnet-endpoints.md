I wrote a **primer** about Azure Virtual Network (VNet) service endpoints and private endpoints. The series is composed of three blog posts:

- Part 1, shown above, is about Azure VNet service endpoints. ([PDF](pdfs/blog-azure-service-endpoints.pdf){ target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" } | [archived webpage](https://web.archive.org/web/20210127102711/https://www.fugue.co/blog/cloud-network-security-101-azure-virtual-network-service-endpoints){ target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" })
- Part 2 is about Azure Private Link and private endpoints. ([PDF](pdfs/blog-azure-private-link-endpoints.pdf){ target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" } | [archived webpage](https://web.archive.org/web/20210419072230/https://www.fugue.co/blog/cloud-network-security-101-azure-private-link-private-endpoints){ target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" })
- Part 3 compares service endpoints and private endpoints. ([PDF](pdfs/blog-azure-service-vs-private-endpoints.pdf){ target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" } | [archived webpage](https://web.archive.org/web/20220129133834/https://www.fugue.co/blog/cloud-network-security-101-azure-service-endpoints-vs.-private-endpoints){ target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" })

To write these articles, I interviewed Fugue's director of security and extensively reviewed Azure's documentation. I then validated the information using my Azure subscription. The images are from Azure's docs.
